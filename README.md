# HelloWorld
Just getting my feet wet again.
I am a highly experienced software engineer, who took a long hiatus.  I am returning to the field, modifying a project for a former colleague.  The project is legacy code and needs to be upgraded.  In the process I'm upgrading my skills.  Like all projects this one is growing.  It requires source code control, and I'm setting this up.
